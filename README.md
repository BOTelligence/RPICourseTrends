# RPICourseTrends
RPI Course Data Platform built by Python Web Crawler under RCOS(Rensselaer Center for Open Source)
## What is RPICourseTrends?
RPICourseTrends is a data platform that shows the trends of number of students in each RPI course. Its mission is to help students evaluate courses by knowing retention rate of each course. 
 
 Compared to existing course evaluation websites, 
 RPICourseTrends does not build on student ratings. 
 Instead, it collects the number of students in each course 
 directly from RPI Student Information System every day during 
 one semester. 
 
 This data will be stored and visualized on a web 
 platform open to RPI students who are interested. Our target 
 audiences include student who need some data to help 
 them evaluate RPI courses and who would to choose a professor 
 for one course.

## Contributing
Our team is currently working on the essential coding of RPICourseTrends. We use Python for the backend as well as web crawler, and vue.js for the front end. There might be several structural alternation. Once we settle the structure down in early 2019, we will provide detailed documentation for people who are interested to contribute on RPICourseTrends.
